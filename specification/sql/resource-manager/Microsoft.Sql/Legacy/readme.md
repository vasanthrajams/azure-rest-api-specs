## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the Sql API.

``` yaml
title: SqlManagementClient
description: 'The Azure SQL Database management API provides a RESTful set of web services that interact with Azure SQL Database services to manage your databases. The API enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete databases.'
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2014-04
```

### Tag: package-2014-04

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2014-04` is specified on the command line.

APIs must only be added to this section when the API is publicly available in at least 1 production region and at least 1 generated client has been tested end-to-end.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2014-04'

## Code Generation

### Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-node
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-ruby
    after_scripts:
      - bundle install && rake arm:regen_all_profiles['azure_mgmt_sql']
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
  - repo: azure-powershell
```

### Python

## Validation

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: TrackedResourceListByImmediateParent
    reason: This warning gives many false positives for proxy resources.
  - suppress: GuidUsage
    reason: This warning gives many positives for existing APIs that cannot be changed.
  - suppress: EnumInsteadOfBoolean
    reason: This warning gives many positives for existing APIs that cannot be changed.
```
